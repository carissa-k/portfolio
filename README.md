# Portfolio Assignment

## Page Description

This portfolio page is built to showcase a sample of my work using flexbox and CSS. For now, the smaller images are placeholders that will be populated with future web applications that I will develop during this course.

This page satisfies the following requirements of the assignment:

- Shows my name, bio, samples of my work and contact information in a clean, organized layout
- The navigation and contact links all function correctly
- The main work image links to the specific application and the smaller work images have placeholder links for future projects
- The CSS includes media queries so the page layout changes at two breakpoints
- The page is live in GitHub and loads with no errors
